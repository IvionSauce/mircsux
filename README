A simple python script dedicated to converting a mIRC style log to an irssi style log. Written once for a friend
migrating IRC logging setups. I think it worked decently, but I'm not sure whether time/dates were completely correct.
So, user beware! ;>

Example usage:
mircsux.py mirc.log irssi.log

It will print any unconverted lines, that start with a control-character (\x03), to the stdout.
